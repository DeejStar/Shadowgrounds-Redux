Notes
-----

Shadowgrounds specific code is under /shadowgrounds, and Shadowgrounds Survivor under /survivor.<br/>
Shadowgrounds does not use PhysX, but Shadowgrounds Survivor does.<br/>
PhysX SDK can be obtained from NVIDIA [here](http://developer.nvidia.com/physx/) or

To get the game assets, you need a copy of each game.


Special Notes
-------------

The Shadowgrounds games are quite old and possibly very messy - these sources have not been cleaned too much.<br/>
There may also be references to older projects, such as "Disposable" or "DH", which mean our very first game,
an (RTS) prototype from 2001-2003. (It should be possible to enable several RTS commands such as unit groups,
switching sides to aliens and so on.)<br/>
It's also worth noting that the source code has a lot of "hacks" and "todos". It is in many ways messy and
could be hard to understand.<br/>
We haven't had a commercial name for the game engine, but internally it's been called "Storm3D". Storm3D is
partially based on work by the awesome Finnish programmer Sebastian Aaltonen, from whom we bought the original
code in 2000/2001.

Good luck! :)
